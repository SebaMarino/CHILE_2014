      	The  Victor M. Blanco telescope at the observatory cerro tololo (CTIO) is one of the telescopes used in the 90’s
      	decade to measure the expansion of the universe and its deceleration,  but the astronomers got surprised when
      	they discovered that indeed it was being the opposite, the expansion was being accelerated by something.
      	A new instrument called the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) was installed in 2012.
      	</p>

	This camera contains 61 CCD’s, each one of 520 Mpix and a total field of view of 2.2 degrees. It was designed to make surveys of extragalactic objects to have a better comprehension of what is causing this accelerated expansion.

The Chile-Harvard Innovative Learning Exchange Program, in which students from various background worked on such data sets in  Chile for two weeks.. 


DATA

	Raw CCD images from the Victor M. Blanco Telescope’s Dark Energy Camera (DECam) at CTIO
64 CCDs / 40 fields of view / 16 epochs over 4 nights
Over 1 TB of raw image data per night.
Unique combination of cadence, depth and field of view.
Allows the study of objects that vary in the U-band with time-scales of a few hours in a large volume of the Universe.

AIM:

	Develop fast, cost-effective computational methods to process and analyze DECam data in order to construct light curves in the U band.


	For each CCD, we first identify the pixels with large ADU values using 99.6% quantile This gives a binary image of 'bright pixels', which are possible sources, and 'faint pixels', which we use to estimate background. Second, w. For each small block, we calculate the skewness and kurtosis of the observed ADUs to rule out cosmic rays. For the rest, we fit Gaussian model to give the catalogue containing positions, flux, and errors of the the sources. Last, we match catalogues of observations across time to give light curves.


Procedure:

1) Detect pixels with high values and measure the background level and 

For each CCD, we first identify the pixels with large ADU values using 99.6% quantile This gives a binary image of 'bright pixels', which are possible sources, and 'faint pixels', which we use to estimate background.

2) Identify blocks 
We single out possible sources by finding the smallest blocks containing connected 'bright pixels'
3) Cosmic rays test
For each small block, we calculate the skewness and kurtosis of the observed ADUs to rule out cosmic rays.

4) Gaussian fit: position, shape, pixel coordinates
We fit a Gaussian model to construct a catalogue containing positions, flux, spread and errors of the the sources for each CCD and epoch.

5) Transform to celestial world coordinates
Using the header information of each fits file, we transform the position of the sources and its errors to world celestial coordinates (Right Ascension  and Declination)
 
6) Calibration with Standard stars from Sloan
The previous steps were done also for observations pointing to standard fields. One of them was a field covered by the Sloan Digital Survey, and it was used for transform from ADU to magnitudes in the U band.
 
7) Matching between epochs
Using the celestial coordinates and its errors of each catalogue, we performed a matching of the objects through the different epochs.

Results:

1) image of the binary map and blocks with different colors

2) cosmic ray analysis image comparing a star and a CR

3) Gaussian fit

Future work:

- Improve the cosmic ray detection
- Add gaussian mixture
- Use a more realistic profile for the Point Spread Function (PSF)
- Use others standard fields
- Improve the distance function using object data (like flux) at the epochs in the object-matching process.
